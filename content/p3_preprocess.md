Preprocess urban blocks
{: .label .label-step}
* Drag and drop the layers to QGIS
* <b>Reproject</b> layer <i>boundaries</i>
* <b>Reproject</b> layer <i>block_outlines</i>
* <b>Extract by location</b>
  * Extract features from: <i>blocks_reprojected</i>
  * By comparing features from: <i>boundaries_reprojected
* Get <b>Centroid</b> of layer <i>blocks_extracted</i>
* <b>Buffer</b> and dissolve <i>centroids</i> (800m)
* Drag and drop Blocks, Centroids and Boundary to save layers on GeoPackage<br>
