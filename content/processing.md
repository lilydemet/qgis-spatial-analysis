# Walkability Index
what is it and how will we get there
apply spatial network analysis tools in QGIS to estimate and visualize a walkability index based on open data
Urban blocks will be used as samples, so in the end, each block will be scored with a walkability index.
workflow overview 
preprocesss, do network analysis (agreggate)/analyzie - Visualize 

## Pre-processing 
Before we can perform spatial network analysis we first must run some geoprocessing 

- census-DAs.geojson
- urban-blocks.geojson
- OSM-street-networks.geojson
- business-licenses.geojson

Urban blocks will be used as samples, so in the end, each block will be scored with a walkability index.
