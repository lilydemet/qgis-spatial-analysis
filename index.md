# Advanced QGIS: Spatial Network Analysis

In this workshop you'll learn how to apply spatial network analysis tools in QGIS to estimate and visualize a walkability index based on open data from the [City of Vancouver](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/pages/home/). The geoprocessing workflows employed in this workshop require prerequisite familiarity with the QGIS interface and basic spatial analysis tools. Checkout the Research Commons' workshop on [map making with QGIS](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/gis-intro-qgis/) if you're new to GIS. 
    
<br>
By the end of this workshop you will have experience:

- using graphical models to visualize and deploy complex workflows
- joining layers both by attribute and location 
- performing mathematical operations on attribute fields using field calculator 
- extracting attribute data both by location and expression
- visualizing network analysis for map layout
